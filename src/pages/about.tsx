          </h2>
          <p className="py-2 text-white/90">
            MegaLAN is the biggest LAN and console party in Sydney. Held at UNSW
            three times a year, MegaLAN is exclusively an event catered to
            gamers and tech fans from all backgrounds and of all interests, with
            initiatives that strive to actively include attendees of minority
            demographics.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2 text-white/90">
            MegaLAN is held across two floors of the Science and Engineering
            Building, occupying 8 different rooms and halls. Our ever-expanding
            offerings currently include a classic BYO PC/laptop LAN section with
            an Esports Stage, BYO console gaming, arcade games, fighting games,
            cosplay and Virtual Reality.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2 text-white/90">
            We are extremely proud to be able to not only keep the tradition of
            LANs alive, but thriving and growing by providing state-of-the-art
            internet access, power and security for all attendees to bring their
            own computer, console or mobile device. For those who aren&#39;t
            able to bring their own devices for gaming, we have a vast range of
            freeplay PCs, consoles and VR headsets that we encourage everyone to
            try out and have fun!
          </p>
          <p className="py-2 text-white/90">
            There are so many things to love about MegaLAN - some have likened
            it to a gaming and tech convention, but at a more grassroots level,
            and others say it&#39;s a showcase of the most exciting things in
            gaming and tech. But no matter where you&#39;re from, MegaLAN is
            made for gamers, by gamers - a place where the magic of gaming comes
            to life!
